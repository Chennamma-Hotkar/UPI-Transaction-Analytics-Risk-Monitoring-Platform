# UPI Transaction Analytics & Risk Monitoring Platform

A machine learning-powered platform to detect fraudulent UPI transactions, score transaction risk in real time, and provide actionable insights through an analytics dashboard.

---

## Overview

With UPI payments growing at an unprecedented scale in India, traditional manual fraud detection simply cannot keep up. This project tackles that gap by building an automated pipeline that ingests transaction data, runs it through ML models, assigns risk scores, and surfaces suspicious activity on a live monitoring dashboard.

## Features

- **Transaction Analytics** — Analyze spending patterns, frequency, time-of-day behavior, and merchant activity
- **Risk Scoring Engine** — Classifies every transaction as Low, Medium, or High risk using a weighted multi-factor model
- **Fraud Detection** — Identifies patterns like high-frequency micro-transactions, sudden amount spikes, and unusual device/location combos
- **Mule Account Detection** — Flags accounts that show layering behavior indicative of money laundering
- **Anomaly Detection** — Unsupervised detection of outlier transactions using Isolation Forest
- **Real-Time Alerts** — Triggers alerts when a transaction breaches configurable risk thresholds
- **Monitoring Dashboard** — Visual overview of transaction volume, risk distribution, and flagged events
- **Exportable Reports** — Download analysis results as CSV or PDF

## Machine Learning Models

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | Baseline supervised fraud classifier |
| Random Forest | High-accuracy supervised fraud classifier |
| Isolation Forest | Unsupervised anomaly detection |

### Target Metrics

| Metric | Goal |
